This package defines the MATCH model for Pyomo.

core_modules is a list of required modules which may be used in the future
for error checking.

An additional module is required to describe fuel costs - either
fuel_cost which specifies a simple flat fuel cost that can vary by load
zone and period, or fuel_markets which specifies a tiered supply curve.


Most applications of MATCH will also benefit from optional modules such as
transmission, local_td, reserves, etc.
